# I'm learning some basic Pascal

I decided to learn a peice of history with Pascal being based off [ALGOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL). I came across it in a wikipedia rabbit hole researching Nokia. It seemed interesting and I decided to do it for some kicks and giggles. You know, learning an almost dead programming language thats almost 60 years old isn't exactly the most practical thing. 

The files uploaded right now are useless. It is the very start I used to setup my IDE. I'm using Lazarus IDE to program in Pascal for x86.
